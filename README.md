The graph “Temperature Evolution Over Time (Linear Decay)”. It represents the linear decay of temperature over time. Here are the key details:

X-axis: The x-axis is labeled “Time (hours)” and ranges from 0 to 8 hours.

Y-axis: The y-axis is labeled “Temperature” and ranges from 0.0 to 1.0.

Line Graph: A single blue line on the graph represents the temperature’s linear decay over time. It starts at a value of 1.0 and decreases to 0.0 over the course of 8 hours.
